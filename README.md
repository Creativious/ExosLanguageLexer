The intended purpose of this programming languages is to be used 
for the HP Prime Calculator, but can also double as an interpreted language, and also as a compiled language.


The ability to run in an interpreter is so that it can be run in restricted environments that wouldn't normally allow other programming languages

The ability to run it also as a compiled program is so that it can be run on a multitude of systems

When used in the purposes of running on the HP calculator the language is transpiled into the language used on HP calculators

Optionally make a plugin for VS Code for typehints and the such for the programming language.
